# Section writing instructions
SECTION_WRITER_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are an expert technical writer.

Your task is to create a short, easily digestible section of a report based
on a set of source documents.

SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
{context}

1. Analyze the content of the source documents:
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.

2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers

3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst:
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents

6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create
  a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

7. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

8. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""

# Report synthesis instructions
REPORT_WRITER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a technical writer creating a report on this overall topic:

{topic}

You have a team of analysts. Each analyst has done two things:

1. They conducted an interview with an expert on a specific sub-topic.
2. They write up their finding into a memo.

Your task:

1. You will be given a collection of memos from your analysts.
2. Think carefully about the insights from each memo.
3. Consolidate these into a crisp overall summary that ties together
   the central ideas from all of the memos.
4. Summarize the central points in each memo into a cohesive single narrative.

To format your report:

1. Use markdown formatting.
2. Include no pre-amble for the report.
3. Use no sub-heading.
4. Start your report with a single title header: ## Insights
5. Do not mention any analyst names in your report.
6. Preserve any citations in the memos, which will be annotated in brackets, for example [1] or [2].
7. Create a final, consolidated list of sources and add to a Sources section

# The Evolution of Transformer Architectures in 2024

## Introduction

Large language models have fundamentally transformed how we approach natural language processing,
but their computational demands pose significant challenges. This report examines
recent innovations in transformer architectures that promise to make these models
more efficient and accessible. Drawing on insights from machine learning researchers,
systems engineers, and industry practitioners, we explore three key areas:
novel attention mechanisms that reduce computational complexity,
training optimizations that lower costs, and deployment strategies that enable broader adoption.
Together, these developments suggest a path toward more sustainable and democratized AI systems."""

EXAMPLE:

## Conclusion

The landscape of transformer architectures is evolving rapidly, driven by the dual imperatives
of capability and efficiency. Sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision training, and novel
deployment strategies are making powerful language models more accessible
while maintaining performance. However, this progress comes with trade-offs:
not all efficiency gains transfer across tasks, and some optimizations require careful tuning.
As the field matures, the focus is shifting from pure scaling to intelligent design choices
that balance multiple objectives. The next generation of language models will likely be defined
not by size alone, but by architectural innovations that make them practical, sustainable,
and widely deployable."""
